# Equation-Solver
Two unknown equation systems from the first degree can be solved with this. Just enter the constants.

x and y are variables and a, b and c are constants where:

a1x + b1y = c1

a2x + b2y = c2

To solve this kind of equations, enter the constants in this sample order, constant of x comes first, constant of y comes second and the result of the equation comes last. Otherwise, you may find wrong answers.

Hope this helps!
